    <h2> Art </h2>
    <p> I have always loved to draw. I have been creating art ever since seventh grade. My favorite medium to use is pen and paper. It is a lot of fun to express myself through art. I am in the AP art class at MHS this year. </p>
    <h2> Dance </h2>
    <p> Dancing is another one of my biggest passions. It is very expressive and creative. When I dance, I can feel energy and peace coursing through my body. It is a great way to stay in shape, both mentally and physically. </p>
